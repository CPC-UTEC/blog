<div class="topic">Introduction</div>

Many situations in mathematics and computer science can be expresed by two things:

1. A set of points
2. Lines joining some pairs of points

And if we disregard the properties of the joins (length, shape, etc) and we only pay attention to which pairs are joined and which are not, then
we arrive at the mathematical notion of a graph. Formally, we have:

**Definition 1.** A graph $G$ is and ordered pair $(V, E)$, where $V$ is some set and $E$ is a set of 2-point subsets of $V$.
The elements of $V$ are called vertices of the graph $G$ and the elements of $E$ edges of $G$.

**Definition 2.** A directed graph $G$ is and ordered pair $(V, E)$, where $V$ is some set and $E$ is a set pairs of elements of $V$.

Now, we can express different situations using the definition of a graph and directed graph. For example.

* The statement "Descartes loves Sofia and Sofia loves Descartes" can be expresed as a graph 

  $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ where $V_1 = \{\text{Descartes}, \text{Sofia}\}$ and 
  $E_1 = \{\{\text{Descartes}, \text{Sofia}\}\}$

* Similarly, it can be expresed as a directed graph

  $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ where $V_2 = \{\text{Descartes}, \text{Sofia}\}$ and 
  $E_2 = \{(\text{Descartes}, \text{Sofia}), (\text{Sofia}, \text{Descartes})\}$

Here $E_{G}$ represents a relationship of love. In the same manner, we can define a graph to express some relationship between a set of elements.

**Observation 1.** If $(u, v) \in E_{G}$. It does not imply that $(v, u) \in E_{G}$

Now, we understand the definition of a graph. Next, we need to known some popular graphs.

* Complete graph $K_n$

$V = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$

$E = V \times V \setminus \{\{u, u\}, u \in V\}$

* Cycle $C_n$

$V = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$

$E = \{\{i, i + 1\}: i = 1, 2, \dots, n - 1\} \cup \{\{1, n\}\}$

* Path $P_n$

$V = \{0, 1, \dots, n\}$

$E = \{\{i - 1, i\}: i = 1, 2, \dots, n\}$


* Complete bipartite graph $K_{n, m}$

$V = \{u_1, \dots, u_n\} \cup \{v_1, \dots, v_m\}$

$E = \{\{u_i, v_j\}: i = 1, 2, \dots, n, j = 1, 2, \dots, m \}$
